"""Deterministic Foundry routing for CloudSec incident / VM actions.

Every cloud action (incident counts, incident lists, investigation, VM
operations) is expressed as a single natural-language prompt sent to the
Cloud Incident Response prompt agent on Azure AI Foundry. That agent owns the
IncidentResponseTool (an OpenAPI tool backed by the CloudSec Azure Function),
so the UI never needs the live function key.

The prompts ask for terse, parseable replies where the UI needs structure
(e.g. the daily/weekly/monthly counts) and readable text elsewhere.
